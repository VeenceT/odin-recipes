    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>
      Yummiest meatloaf I've ever tasted. It has so much flavor and stays very
      moist. Everyone I've served it to loves it. My kids go crazy over it and
      don't realize they are consuming veggies. This recipe freezes well.
      Whenever I take the time to do a recipe that takes time (like chopping
      veggies) and freezes well, I multiply the recipe, eating one for dinner
      that night and freezing a few more for later.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef.</li>
      <li>⅔ pound ground turkey.</li>
      <li>1 egg.</li>
      <li>¾ cup finely chopped celery.</li>
      <li>¾ cup regular rolled oats.</li>
      <li>½ cup skim milk.</li>
      <li>½ cup ketchup.</li>
      <li>½ cup finely chopped onion.</li>
      <li>½ cup finely chopped green bell pepper.</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley.</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard powder.</li>
      <li>⅔ teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic.</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step(s):</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Combine ground beef, ground turkey, egg, celery, rolled oats, skim milk,
        ketchup, onion, green pepper, parsley, dry mustard, salt, minced garlic,
        and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined; mixture will be
        moist. Transfer mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read meat thermometer
        inserted into the center of the meatloaf reads at least 160 degrees F
        (70 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours. Meatloaf may still look pink inside
        due to ketchup.

    </ol>
